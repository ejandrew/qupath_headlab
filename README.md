# qupath_headlab 
# This is a repository for all Qupath classifiers generated by EJA in the Head Lab. All classifiers were trained using Random Trees and staining images representative of multiple intensities from frontal and occipital corticies. 
# To use classifiers, download and copy files into the "pixel-classifiers" folder under the "classifiers" folder of the Qupath project. If the folder does not exist, you may create one with these exact titles.
